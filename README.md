<h1>Accessible Web Design - Contact Form Challenge ♿</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project is part of the <strong>"Learn Accessible Web Design"</strong> module in the <strong>Frontend Development</strong> specialization course offered by <strong>Scrimba</strong>. The challenge focuses on building an accessible contact form, ensuring usability and inclusivity while avoiding common accessibility pitfalls.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the previous version that relied on mouseover and mouseout events to show the warning for an inactive submit button, <a href="https://github.com/leoosalles/scrimba-accessible-js-event-listener-1">which can be accessed by clicking here</a>, this project offers a <strong>more accessible solution</strong>. Instead of requiring users to <strong>hover over the button</strong>, the validation feedback is <strong>displayed persistently</strong>, making it visible to <strong>keyboard users, touchscreen users, and those relying on assistive technologies</strong>.
</p>
<h2>Features ✨</h2>
<p>
  ✅ <strong>User-friendly contact form</strong> with clearly labeled inputs.
</p>
<p>
  ✅ <strong>Real-time validation</strong>, enabling the submit button only when all fields are completed.
</p>
<p>
  ✅ <strong></strong>Accessible feedback mechanism, ensuring usability for all users.
</p>
<h2>Technologies Used 🛠️</h2>
<p>
  🖥️ <strong>HTML5</strong> – Semantic structure for accessibility improvements.
</p>
<p>
  🎨 <strong>CSS3</strong> – Styled components for clarity and usability.
</p>
<p>
  ⚡ <strong>JavaScript (ES6)</strong> – Event handling for input validation.
</p>
<h2>Accessibility Improvement ⚡</h2>
<p>
  In the earlier version, the <strong>popover message only appeared on hover</strong>, making it <strong>inaccessible</strong> for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Keyboard users</strong>, who might never see the warning.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mobile users</strong>, who lack a hover state.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Screen readers</strong>, which might not announce the warning properly.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  🔹 <strong>Solution:</strong> In this project, the warning remains <strong>persistently visible</strong> when the submit button is disabled, ensuring that <strong>all users receive the necessary feedback</strong> without relying on hover interactions.
